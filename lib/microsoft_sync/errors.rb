# When the sync job fails, we show an error to the user. Because internal error
# messages may not be safe to show to the user, we opt-in to showing the user
# the message for certain errors by making it a PublicError, which provides a
# public_message. This defaults to just the error `message` but can be
# overridden, in case we want to display a different message to users than what
# is in our logs/failed job/etc.
